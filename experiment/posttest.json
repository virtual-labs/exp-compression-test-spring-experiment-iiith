            "question": "A close helical spring has a stiffness of 10 N/mm. Its length when fully compressed, with adjacent coils toucing each other is 400 mm.The modulus of rigidity of the material of the spring is 8 x 10<sup>4</sup> N/mm<sup>2</sup>. What is the wire diameter and the mean coil diameter if their ratio = 1/10",
