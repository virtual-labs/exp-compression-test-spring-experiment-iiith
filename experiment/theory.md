- Springs are elastic member which distort under load and regain their original shape when load is
removed. They are used in railway carriages, motor cars, scooters, motorcycles, rickshaws,
Governors etc. According to their uses the springs perform the following Functions:
  1. To absorb shock or impact loading as in carriage springs.
  2. To store energy as in clock springs.
  3. To apply forces to and to control motions as in brakes and clutches.
  4. To measure forces as in spring balances.
  5. To change the variations characteristic of a member as in flexible mounting of motors.
   
- The spring is usually made of either high carbon steel (0.7 to 1.0%) or medium carbon alloy steels.
Phosphor bronze, brass, 18/8 stainless steel and Monel and other metal alloys are used for
Corrosion resistance spring. Several types of spring are available for different application. Springs
may classify as helical springs, leaf springs and flat spring depending upon their shape. They are
fabricated of high shear strength materials such as high carbon alloy steels spring form elements of
not only mechanical system but also structural system. In several cases it is essential to idealize
Complex structural systems by suitable spring.
