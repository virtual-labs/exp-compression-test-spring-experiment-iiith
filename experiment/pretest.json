                "a": "Bending stress is the normal stress that an object encounters when it is subjected to a large load at a particular point that causes the object to bend and become fatigued.",
                "b": "Shear stress, force tending to cause deformation of a material by slippage along a plane or planes parallel to the imposed stress.",
                "c": "Torsion stress is the stress caused due to twisting of an object due to an applied torque.",
                "d": "Crushing stress (bearing stress) is a special type of localized compressive stress which occurs at the surface of contact of two members that are relatively at rest."
