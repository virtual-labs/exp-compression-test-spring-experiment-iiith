**Introduction**

A coil spring, also known as a helical spring, is a mechanical device that is typically used to store energy and subsequently release it, absorb shock, or maintain a force between surfaces in contact. They are made of an elastic material formed into the shape of a helix, which returns to its natural length when unloaded.
