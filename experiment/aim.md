**Introduction**

 A Coil spring, also known as a helical spring, is a mechanical device, which is typically used to store energy and subsequently release it, to absorb shock, or to maintain a force between contacting surfaces. They are made of an elastic material formed into the shape of a helix which returns to its natural length when unloaded.

Metal coil springs are made by winding a wire around a shaped former - a cylinder is used to form cylindrical coil springs. 

**Objective**

To determine the deflection, stiffness & strain energy of a coiled spring.
