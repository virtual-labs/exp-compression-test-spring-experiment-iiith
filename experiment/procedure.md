**Procedure**

1. Measure the diameter of the wire of the spring by using the micrometer.
2. Measure the diameter of spring coils by using the vernier caliper
3. Count the number of turns.
4. Insert the spring in the spring testing machine and load the spring by a suitable weight and note
 the corresponding axial deflection in tension or compression.
5. Increase the load and take the corresponding axial deflection readings.
6. Plot a curve between load and deflection. The shape of the curve gives the stiffness of the
 Spring.


**Virtual Procedure**
1. Start the Experiment by clicking the play button.
2. Observe the simulation of the spring in the simulation window.
3. The observation table provides the deflections and the stiffness of the spring based on the current parameters of the spring. 
4. Change the parameters using the sliders and the changes would be reflected in the simulation as well as in the observation table.
5. The Experiment allows you to pause/play/restart the simulation to view the values of different parameters at every stage of simulation.
